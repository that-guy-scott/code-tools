# Task: Create a version 2 of the src/ollama-cli.js code.

We are currently planning this out.
Let's build out a technical specification for this new code.
Save your tech spec in 2 places, a file called ollamav2.tech.spec.md and another in the postgresql table called tech_specs.
You'll need to create a table for these tech specs so be sure to save the sql to the project.


v2 Features!
- MCP Support!
    - We should support tooling. look at .mcp.json We'll be using all kinds of MCP servers so this needs to be flexible.
    - This should us SOLID OOP design but still be contained in a single file called ollama-cli.js (rename the old one to ollama-cli.js.old)


This is the main thing I want to accomplish in this v2 version.
What do you think? Are there other features we should have?

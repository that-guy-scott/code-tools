# 🚀 MCP Expansion Plan: "More MCP in Our Lives!"

## Overview
Systematic expansion of MCP ecosystem beyond current JetBrains integration using branch-based development workflow.

## Git Workflow for Each Phase
```bash
# For each phase:
git checkout -b mcp-phase-N
# Develop and configure MCP servers
./test-mcp.sh  # Comprehensive testing
# If tests pass:
git add . && git commit -m "Phase N: Add [server names] MCP integration"
git checkout main && git merge mcp-phase-N
```

## Phase 1: Essential Development MCP Servers 🔧
**Branch**: `mcp-phase-1`

### Target Servers:
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Repository management, issues, PRs, code analysis
- **Git MCP Server**: Enhanced version control, commit analysis, branch management
- **Filesystem MCP Server**: Secure file operations with configurable access controls
- **Memory MCP Server**: Persistent project context and knowledge graph across sessions

### Installation Commands:
```bash
# GitHub integration
claude mcp add github -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

# Git operations
claude mcp add git -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-git

# Filesystem access
claude mcp add filesystem --env ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES="/home/owner/repo" -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem

# Persistent memory
claude mcp add memory -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

### Testing Criteria:
- All servers connect successfully
- Basic operations work (repo access, file ops, memory persistence)
- Existing JetBrains integration remains stable
- No conflicts between servers

### Expected Benefits:
- Direct GitHub repository management
- Enhanced git operations and history analysis
- Secure file system access beyond IDE
- Persistent context across Claude sessions

## Phase 2: Enhanced Development Workflow 🔄
**Branch**: `mcp-phase-2`

### Target Servers:
- **Postgres MCP Server**: Database connectivity for full-stack development
- **Sentry MCP Server**: Real-time error monitoring and debugging integration
- **Socket MCP Server**: Dependency security analysis for CLI tools
- **Sequential Thinking MCP Server**: Advanced problem-solving capabilities

### Installation Commands:
```bash
# Database access
claude mcp add postgres --env DATABASE_URL="your_db_url" -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres

# Error monitoring
claude mcp add sentry --env SENTRY_DSN="your_sentry_dsn" -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sentry

# Security analysis
claude mcp add socket -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-socket

# Advanced reasoning
claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

### Testing Criteria:
- Integration with Phase 1 servers works seamlessly
- Database queries and error monitoring functional
- Security analysis identifies real vulnerabilities
- Sequential thinking enhances problem-solving

### Expected Benefits:
- Full-stack development capabilities
- Proactive error detection and monitoring
- Security-first dependency management
- Enhanced AI reasoning for complex problems

- **Docker MCP Server**: Container management and orchestration
- **Slack MCP Server**: Team communication and notification integration

### Installation Commands:
```bash
# AWS integration
claude mcp add aws --env AWS_REGION="us-east-1" -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-aws

# Container management
claude mcp add docker -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-docker

# Team communication
claude mcp add slack --env SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="your_token" -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-slack
```

### Testing Criteria:
- Full pipeline from development to deployment works
- Cloud resources can be managed safely
- Container operations are secure and functional
- Team notifications integrate smoothly

### Expected Benefits:
- Complete DevOps pipeline automation
- Infrastructure as code capabilities
- Seamless team collaboration
- End-to-end deployment management
